#🎄 Advent of Code — My Coding Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Advent of Code archive! Every December, programmers around the world tackle a series of holiday-themed puzzles released daily, each with two parts to solve. This repo is my personal log of that adventure: a mix of learning, experimenting, and occasionally laughing at my own code 😅.

I primarily solve puzzles in Python 🐍, though I sometimes explore other languages and approaches to challenge myself. Here, you’ll find my solutions, insights into problem-solving strategies, and notes about things that worked — and things that didn’t. Each puzzle is an opportunity to grow as a coder, improve algorithmic thinking, and sharpen debugging skills 🛠️.

While speed and leaderboard positions can be tempting, my focus is on learning and reflection. Every bug, every “aha” moment, and every small victory counts. This repo is my way of documenting that journey, and hopefully providing a helpful reference or inspiration for fellow coders.

Whether you’re here to peek at solutions, compare approaches, or just enjoy some holiday-themed brain teasers, I hope you find this repository engaging and informative 🎁✨. Advent of Code isn’t just about solving puzzles — it’s about the journey, growth, and the little joys along the way.
